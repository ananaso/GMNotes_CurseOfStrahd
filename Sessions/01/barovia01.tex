\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The characters return to the Barovian burgomaster's mansion with Ismark to prepare to leave for Vallaki.
Night is falling, however, and Ismark will not let them leave with Ireena until daybreak. He will also refuse
to let them stay in the mansion due to his distrust of them following the incident with Father Donavich.

\section{Scenes}
\label{sec:Scenes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item They all have an identical dream leading them to Madam Eva at Tser Pool Encampment.
  \item They attempt to shake down Radu for his debt to Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia.
  \item They find out the tavern has no rooms when they go looking for housing.
  \item They encounter the gallows at River Ivlis Crossroads and one PC will see themselves hanging.
  \item They have their fortunes read by Madam Eva and her Tarokka deck.
  \item They see Bluto on the lake and have to rescue Arabelle from drowning.
  \item They are attacked by the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok if they wander north of Lake Zarovich.
  \item They are approached by Eliza Ig'ar (a Vistani at Tser Pool Encampment) to go purchase and deliver a 
  nameday present for her niece, Arabelle, in Vallaki.
  \item They hear the story of the mighty wizard that attacked Strahd a year ago (the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok).
\end{itemize}

\section{Secrets and Clues}
\label{sec:SecretsAndClues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The leather-bound bundle Bildrath asks for contains explorer's packs he previously sold to another,
  now-dead adventuring party.
  \item The ``mist-touched'' Barovians actually lack a soul entirely. Only Strahd, Madam Eva, the Abbot, the hags
  of Old Bonegrinder, Baba Lysaga, and a select few others know this.
  \item Doru discovered, when released by Strahd, that the wizard's body was nowhere to be found; he is 
  convinced that the mage is not dead.
  \item Many Vistani serve as spies for Strahd, although it is impossible to tell which do or do not.
  \item Donavich: Ireena Kolyana isn't the natural daughter of Kolyan Indirovich. Although Ireena never knew, 
  Kolyan found her at the edge of the Svalich Woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. She was but a girl then 
  and seemed to have no memery of her past. Kolyan adopted her and loved her dearly.
  \item Dream Pastries are made from the ground bones of children; addicted parents sell their own children to 
  buy more, for it is the only escape from the terror of living in Barovia.
  \item Morgantha knows a bit of the Vistani as spies for Strahd and the locations of their camps.
  \item Radu Radovich is on mission for Arrigal and seeks to earn Strahd's favor. He will try to eavesdrop on 
  the Tarokka reading with Madam Eva if present.
  \item The Tome of Strahd is located inside Old Bonegrinder; only the hags know it is there.
  \item Eliza Ig'ar is a spy for Strahd and will attempt to get information about the PCs in conversation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fantastic Locations}
\label{sec:FantasticLocations}
\subsection{E1 - Bildrath's Mercantile}
  Only shop in town. Dark and worn down inside. Items sold at ridiculous markup (10x). Lots of gear looks 
  slightly used.
\subsection{E2 - Blood of the Vine Tavern}
  Village tavern. Owned by three Vistani sisters. Clearly finely appointed in the past, now shoddy.
\subsection{E3 - Mad Mary's Townhouse}
  Humble two-story townhouse. Owned by Mad Mary. House is disheveled and clearly unkempt for the past week.
\subsection{E4 - Burgomaster's Mansion}
  Small mansion. Gates are twisted and torn, grounds/lawn are very unkempt and clearly heavily-trodden recently.
  Walls are charred and clawed, and all windows are shattered and boarded over. Insides are well-furnished yet
  worn, and there are holy symbols everywhere.
\subsection{E5 - Church}
  Wood and stone church, in need of maintenance and heavily damaged from sources of evil. Mildewy and poorly 
  lit, except in the main chapel area. Scant decorations and poorly appointed rooms.
\subsection{E6 - Cemetery}
  Tightly packed with gravestones more or less worn by time. Enclosed by a wrought iron fence.
\subsection{D - River Ivlis}
  Cold, clear blue river roughly 50 feet wide and 5-10 feet deep. Spanned by arching stone bridges at two points.
\subsection{F - River Ivlis Crossroads}
  Crossroad of Old Svalich road, heading northwest, southwest, and east. Old wooden gallows on the high ground 
  in the western fork. Small plot of crumbling graves across from the gallows.
\subsection{G - Tser Pool Encampment}
  Small camp of Vistani in clearing beside small lake beneath huge cliffs. A few yurts/tents litter the
  outskirts, with a handful of brightly-painted wagons circling the central bonfire.
\subsection{H - Tser Falls}
  A moldy stone bridge stretching over a natural chasm that falls nearly a thousand feet down. Chasm walls are 
  slippery and sheer. Bridge is slick and moist but safe to cross.
\subsection{I - Castle Ravenloft Crossroads (Black Carriage)}
  Crossroad of Old Svalich road, heading northwest, southwest, and east. East heads to Castle Ravenloft, 
  although it is too foggy to see from the crossroads; this road has patches of cobblestone.
\subsection{L - Lake Zarovich}
  Large lake, perfectly still and dark. Reflects the sky very clearly. Rowboats pulled up on south shore, with a
  fourth boat in the middle of the lake.
\subsection{M - Base of Mount Baratok (Mad Made of Mount Baratok)}
  Alpine mountain. Thick coniferous forest interspersed with large rocky outcrops. Snowy peak above the thick
  layer of fog.
\subsection{O - Old Bonegrinder}
  Slouching windmill and once a grain mill, with smoking curling invitingly from the crooked pipe chimney. Grass
  is rife with rodents, snakes, and spiders. Three large stone monoliths in the field behind the windmill.


\section{Important NPCs}
\label{sec:ImportantNPCs}
\subsection{Bildrath Cantemir}
  Proprieter of Bildrath's Mercantile. Doesn't care for adventurers beyond their money. Will offer minor discount
  to adventurers that retrieve previously-sold merchandise for him.
\subsection{Parriwimple}
  Parpol Cantemir, nephew and stock-boy to Bildrath. Simple-minded yet large and powerfully built. Devoted to 
  his uncle, yet loves to ask adventurers about their travels.
\subsection{Ismark Kolyana}
  Son of the former burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich. Brother to Ireena. Guarded, like all Barovians, but 
  desperate for help with Ireena and Strahd. Willing to pay for help if he cannot persuade.
\subsection{Mad Mary}
  Mother of Gertruda. Mad with grief over the disappearance of her daughter a week prior. Will talk with someone
  that treats her kindly.
\subsection{Ireena Kolyana}
  Daught of the former burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich. Sister to Ismark. Striking auburn hair that she dyes 
  black. Strong willed, crude sense of humor, very curious. Knows basic swordplay. Seeks sanctuary from Strahd.
\subsection{Donavich}
  Village priest. Father of Doru. Gone mad with grief for his son's state and constant pleas for help. Extremely
  pious. Cannot bear the thought of his son being killed.
\subsection{Doru}
  Son of Donavich. Stormed Castle Ravenloft with the Mad Mage. Sent back by Strahd as Vampire Spawn to torment
  Donavich and the church. Starved of blood.
\subsection{Morgantha}
  Night hag, disguised as an old woman. Frequently called ``Granny'' by the villagers. Sells Dream Pastries.
