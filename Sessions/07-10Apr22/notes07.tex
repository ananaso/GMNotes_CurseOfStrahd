\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The Party is about to be engaged in battle with the remaining blights outside the Wizard of Wines. When they 
speak with Davian Martikov next, he will reveal the reason that the winery was attacked.


\section{Potential Threads}
\label{sec:PotentialThreads}
\subsection{Wizard of the Wines}
Freeing the winery from the druids will earn the respect of the Martikovs and the Keepers of the Feather. Davian 
will be willing to explain why the druids attacked:
\begin{readout}
  The vineyard is successful due to the three magic ``seeds'' that were buried underneath it long ago by our 
  forebears. Our present misfortune began about 10 winters past, however, when one of them was stolen in the 
  middle of the night right out from under our watchman's nose.
  
  To add to that, we've been fending off ensorcelled scarecrows sent by Baba Lysaga since last winter and about 
  one moon ago we discovered another seed had been dug up and taken; I suspect that hag was using these attacks 
  as cover to search for the gem.
  
  Then finally, as if matters couldn't get any worse, about 5 days past those evil druids managed to get their 
  grubby hands on our final seed and whisk it away to the vile Yester Hill. We tried to attack them and recover 
  the seed but we were no match for their twisted magic. The day you met us, they had arrived with that horde of 
  blights you took out to drive us from our own winery.
\end{readout}
If asked what the seeds look like, Davian will describe them as gems the size and shape of pinecones, each one 
containing a glowing green light as bright as a torch. Davian has no idea what happened to the third gem (i.e. 
the first one stolen).
\par Finally, he will urge the party to help them recover the seeds:
\begin{readout}
  For the good of all Barovia, you must help us recover these seeds. Please, travel to Yester Hill and Berez to 
  retrieve them! While these are places of great evil, you four seem much better equipped to overcome the danger 
  than us.
\end{readout}
If the Party seems undecided about which to pick or is leaning towards Berez, Davian will try to offer them ``the 
advice of an old local'':
\begin{readout}
  While you all are indeed powerful, I would caution you that Berez is certainly the more dangerous of the two.
  Its chief inhabitant, Baba Lysaga, is a vile hag that commands such ancient and terrible curses that even the 
  Devil himself almost needs to show her respect. Additionally, she has ceased her attacks since the second seed 
  went missing and thus I have more fear of future reprisals from the druids for your work here.
\end{readout}

\subsection{Yester Hill}


\subsection{Izek abducts Ireena}
The next time the Party enters Vallaki, they will run into Lord Vasili von Holtz sitting on the steps outside the church reading a book titled ``Guide to Vampire Hunting - Rudolph Van Richten''. If asked about it, he will claim to be ``studying his enemy''. If asked what he's learned about vampires, he'll give misleading tips like the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Vampires are scared of fire because it produces light.
  \item Splashing holy water on a vampire prevents them from shapeshifting.
  \item Don't look in the eyes of a vampire or you risk being permanently put under its spell.
  \item A vampire can be killed by driving a silver stake into his heart.
  \item Dragging a vampire against his will across a threshold will prevent him from leaving that building.
  \item Vampires are weaker in their lair because they tend to let their guard down.
\end{itemize}
Vasili will ask the Party if they've seen Ireena anywhere, claiming to have not seen her for a few days now. If 
the Party asks when the last time he saw her was, he'll say they had dinner together and spent an evening 
strolling the town. If they ask if he has any hunches, he'll say he's ``a little suspicious of Izek, but then 
again, who isn't?''.

\subsection{Tyger, Tyger: Development}
The next time the Party returns to the tavern in Vallaki, they will notice a commotion in the town square; this 
will be the Baron conducting an investigation to find out where the ``beast'' came from. Guards and local 
witnesses are questioned. Gunther and Yelena Arasek admit to hearing ``evil growls'' and scratching sounds coming 
from inside the carnival wagon parked in their stockyard. When pressed, the Araseks admit to seeing the wagon's 
``weird owner'' routinely drop food into the wagon through a hatch in the roof. They also confess that the half-
elf paid them for their silence.

After the burgomaster learns that the tiger belongs to Rictavio, he commands his guards to arrest the mysterious 
bard. If Rictavio thinks the PCs can help him (i.e. if they helped him when the tiger was first loose), he asks 
them to distract the burgomaster and the guards while he gathers his horse, wagon, and tiger (in that order). If 
the PCs ask Rictavio where he plans to go, he tells them about an old tower to the west where he can lie low.
Helping Rictavio will draw the ire of the Baron, however, and the Party will also get run out of town and
subsequently banned; the only way inside will be sneaking over the walls under cover of darkness or using a 
diguise, which will prove extremely difficult without the help of magic given their very unique appearances.

\section{Potential Treasure}
\label{sec:PotentialTreasure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 20 gp discount for retrieving (and not opening) the used merchandise for Bildrath
  \item The ability to ask the Martikovs to deliver the last three barrels of wine to a destination of the 
  Party's choice
\end{itemize}
