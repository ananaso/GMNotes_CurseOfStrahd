\section{Story Notes}
\subsection{Oktober 28}
The Party cleaned out the winery, which hosted a druids and their subordinate vine and twig blights. One of them,
seemingly an elder druid of some sort, had a staff of spongy, black wood that almost seems to radiate evil; this 
staff is now in Patrin's possession. In the cellar, the Party discovered a brown mold that was incredibly cold; it 
appeared to exist to keep the cellar cold enough for storing wine.

After taking a short rest, the Party unlocked the double doors in the main vat area and went out onto the veranda in 
order to go inform the Martikov family that their winery was now free. The remaining blights were still mindlessly 
focused on the door the Party had barred upon entering the winery, until Patrin decided to try waving his new staff 
at them. This did not appear to have any effect besides attracting their attention.

\section{Administrative Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I've added a timezone bot to the discord. Make sure to set up your timezone, since it should help streamline 
  our scheduling discussions.
