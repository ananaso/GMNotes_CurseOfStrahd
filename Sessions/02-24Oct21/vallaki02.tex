  great loss of his family and friends long ago. Avoids entering his rage if possible, since he is addicted to

\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The characters return to the Barovian burgomaster's mansion with Ismark to prepare to leave for Vallaki.
Night is falling, however, and Ismark will not let them leave with Ireena until daybreak. He will also refuse
to let them stay in the mansion due to his distrust of them following the incident with Father Donavich.

\section{Scenes}
\label{sec:Scenes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item They have their fortunes read by Madam Eva and her Tarokka deck.
  \item They see Bluto on the lake and have to rescue Arabelle from drowning.
  \item They are attacked by the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok if they wander north of Lake Zarovich.
\end{itemize}

\section{Secrets and Clues}
\label{sec:SecretsAndClues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The leather-bound bundle Bildrath asks for contains explorer's packs he previously sold to another,
  now-dead adventuring party.
  \item The ``mist-touched'' Barovians actually lack a soul entirely. Only Strahd, Madam Eva, the Abbot, the hags
  of Old Bonegrinder, Baba Lysaga, and a select few others know this.
  \item Many Vistani serve as spies for Strahd, although it is impossible to tell which do or do not.
  \item Dream Pastries are made from the ground bones of children; addicted parents sell their own children to 
  buy more, for it is the only escape from the terror of living in Barovia.
  \item Morgantha knows a bit of the Vistani as spies for Strahd and the locations of their camps.
  \item The Tome of Strahd is located inside Old Bonegrinder; only the hags know it is there.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fantastic Locations}
\label{sec:FantasticLocations}
\subsection{E1 - Bildrath's Mercantile}
  Only shop in town. Dark and worn down inside. Items sold at ridiculous markup (10x). Lots of gear looks 
  slightly used.
\subsection{E4 - Burgomaster's Mansion}
  Small mansion. Gates are twisted and torn, grounds/lawn are very unkempt and clearly heavily-trodden recently.
  Walls are charred and clawed, and all windows are shattered and boarded over. Insides are well-furnished yet
  worn, and there are holy symbols everywhere.
\subsection{D - River Ivlis}
  Cold, clear blue river roughly 50 feet wide and 5-10 feet deep. Spanned by arching stone bridges at two points.
\subsection{F - River Ivlis Crossroads}
  Crossroad of Old Svalich road, heading northwest, southwest, and east. Old wooden gallows on the high ground 
  in the western fork. Small plot of crumbling graves across from the gallows.
\subsection{G - Tser Pool Encampment}
  Small camp of Vistani in clearing beside small lake beneath huge cliffs. A few yurts/tents litter the
  outskirts, with a handful of brightly-painted wagons circling the central bonfire.
\subsection{H - Tser Falls}
  A moldy stone bridge stretching over a natural chasm that falls nearly a thousand feet down. Chasm walls are 
  slippery and sheer. Bridge is slick and moist but safe to cross.
\subsection{I - Castle Ravenloft Crossroads (Black Carriage)}
  Crossroad of Old Svalich road, heading northwest, southwest, and east. East heads to Castle Ravenloft, 
  although it is too foggy to see from the crossroads; this road has patches of cobblestone.
\subsection{L - Lake Zarovich}
  Large lake, perfectly still and dark. Reflects the sky very clearly. Rowboats pulled up on south shore, with a
  fourth boat in the middle of the lake.
\subsection{M - Base of Mount Baratok (Mad Made of Mount Baratok)}
  Alpine mountain. Thick coniferous forest interspersed with large rocky outcrops. Snowy peak above the thick
  layer of fog.
\subsection{O - Old Bonegrinder}
  Slouching windmill and once a grain mill, with smoking curling invitingly from the crooked pipe chimney. Grass
  is rife with rodents, snakes, and spiders. Three large stone monoliths in the field behind the windmill.


\section{Important NPCs}
\label{sec:ImportantNPCs}
\subsection{Bildrath Cantemir}
  Proprieter of Bildrath's Mercantile. Doesn't care for adventurers beyond their money. Will offer minor discount
  to adventurers that retrieve previously-sold merchandise for him.
\subsection{Parriwimple}
  Parpol Cantemir, nephew and stock-boy to Bildrath. Simple-minded yet large and powerfully built. Devoted to 
  his uncle, yet loves to ask adventurers about their travels.
\subsection{Ismark Kolyana}
  Son of the former burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich. Brother to Ireena. Guarded, like all Barovians, but 
  desperate for help with Ireena and Strahd. Willing to pay for help if he cannot persuade.
\subsection{Ireena Kolyana}
  Daught of the former burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich. Sister to Ismark. Striking auburn hair that she dyes 
  black. Strong willed, crude sense of humor, very curious. Knows basic swordplay. Seeks sanctuary from Strahd.
\subsection{Morgantha}
  Night hag, disguised as an old woman. Frequently called ``Granny'' by the villagers. Sells Dream Pastries.


\section{Potential Monsters}
\label{sec:PotentialMonsters}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Swarm of rats
  \item Strahd zombies
  \item Parriwimple
  \item Morgantha
\end{itemize}


\section{Potential Treasure}
\label{sec:PotentialTreasure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 50 gp for escorting Ireena and confirming receipt with Ismark
  \item 20 gp discount for retrieving (and not opening) the used merchandise for Bildrath
\end{itemize}
