\label{sec:StrongStart}


\section{Scenes}
\label{sec:Scenes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Party has their fortunes read by Madam Eva and her Tarokka deck.
  \item They see Bluto on the lake and have to rescue Arabelle from drowning.
  \item They are attacked by the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok if they wander north of Lake Zarovich.
  \item They observe a nightly congregation in the church, and confront Milivoj about the stolen bones.
  \item Urwin asks the party if they can investigate what's holding up the latest shipment of wine.
  \item The party meets Baron Vallakovich and entrusts Ireena into his care.
  \item The Wachter Brothers drunkenly attempt to convince the party to conspire in overthrowing the Baron.
  \item The party discovers the cult headquarters beneath Wachterhaus.
  \item They encounter Izek and his guards replacing the festival posters.
\end{itemize}

\section{Secrets and Clues}
\label{sec:SecretsAndClues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The leather-bound bundle Bildrath asks for contains explorer's packs he previously sold to another,
  now-dead adventuring party.
  \item The ``mist-touched'' Barovians actually lack a soul entirely. Only Strahd, Madam Eva, the Abbot, the hags
  of Old Bonegrinder, Baba Lysaga, and a select few others know this.
  \item Many Vistani serve as spies for Strahd, although it is impossible to tell which do or do not.
  \item Dream Pastries are made from the ground bones of children; addicted parents sell their own children to 
  buy more, for it is the only escape from the terror of living in Barovia.
  \item The Tome of Strahd is located inside Old Bonegrinder; only the hags know it is there.
  \item Milivoj has stolen the bones of St. Andral; Father Lucian will only confide this to a paladin or cleric.
  \item Victor Vallakovich is behind the disappearance of the Butler and the baroness's lady-in-waiting.
  \item Lady Wachter sleeps with the magically preserved corpse of her husband, Nikolai.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fantastic Locations}
\label{sec:FantasticLocations}
\subsection{E1 - Bildrath's Mercantile}
  Only shop in town. Dark and worn down inside. Items sold at ridiculous markup (10x). Lots of gear looks 
  slightly used.
\subsection{E4 - Burgomaster's Mansion}
  Small mansion. Gates are twisted and torn, grounds/lawn are very unkempt and clearly heavily-trodden recently.
  Walls are charred and clawed, and all windows are shattered and boarded over. Insides are well-furnished yet
  worn, and there are holy symbols everywhere.
\subsection{G - Tser Pool Encampment}
  Small camp of Vistani in clearing beside small lake beneath huge cliffs. A few yurts/tents litter the
  outskirts, with a handful of brightly-painted wagons circling the central bonfire.
\subsection{L - Lake Zarovich}
  Large lake, perfectly still and dark. Reflects the sky very clearly. Rowboats pulled up on south shore, with a
  fourth boat in the middle of the lake.
\subsection{M - Base of Mount Baratok (Mad Mage of Mount Baratok)}
  Alpine mountain. Thick coniferous forest interspersed with large rocky outcrops. Snowy peak above the thick
  layer of fog.
\subsection{N1 - St. Andral's Church}
  Church built very similarly to the one in the village of Barovia. Dedicated to the Morninglord, and the former
  restingplace of St. Andral's bones (although the fact that they are missing is recent and not common 
  knowledge).
\subsection{N2 - Blue Water Inn}
  Inn owned by Urwin Martikov. Two-story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof. Often 
  has several ravens perched on the roof. Main gathering place for locals, especially at night. During the day 
  in the common room there is a 60\% chance that Rictavio is there (otherwise in private room); after noon, 
  there are also 2d4 local patrons (commoners) and a 50\% chance of the Wachter Brothers being present; dusk 
  till midnight, there are 2d8 Vallakians along with a 20\% chance of the Wachter Brothers being present and a 
  60\% chance that the Wolf Hunters are present.
\subsection{N3 - Burgomaster's Mansion}
  Headquarters and home to the Burgomaster of Vallaki. Plastered stone building showing clear signs of age and 
  neglect. Every window is covered by drapes. Has an almost constant stream of people coming and going 
  throughout the day on official town business.
\subsection{N4 - Wachterhaus}
  Mansion of the Wachter Family. Two stories and a basement. Incredibly worn down and in need of care.
\subsection{N5 - Arasek Stockyard}
  General store and yard with rentable storage sheds. Owned by Gunther and Yelena Arasek. Rictavio's Carnival 
  Wagon is stored here; he paid the Arasek's generously to not ask questions.
\subsection{N6 - Coffin Maker's Shop}
  Two-story shop. Every window is shuttered tightly, the outside doors are barred from within, and the store is 
  deathly silent. Hosts a nest of six vampire spawn in the top storage room.
\subsection{N7 - Blinsky Toys}
  Cramped and dark toyshop. Barely kept in business through the Baron's patronage.
\subsection{N8 - Town Square}
  Main square of Vallaki. Has central fountain with statue of impressive, yet unknown man facing west. Has tons 
  of flyers proclaiming the latest upcoming festival. Contains stocks for criminals, currently hosting townsfolk
  accused of spreading ``malicious unhappiness''.
\subsection{O - Old Bonegrinder}
  Slouching windmill and once a grain mill, with smoking curling invitingly from the crooked pipe chimney. Grass
  is rife with rodents, snakes, and spiders. Three large stone monoliths in the field behind the windmill.


\section{Important NPCs}
\label{sec:ImportantNPCs}
\subsection{Baron Vargas Vallakovich}
  Burgomaster of Vallaki. Ruthless heel who prides himself on his good breeding and finely honed leadership 
  skills. Brittle ego, with little room for disrespect towards himself or his festivals. Has convinced himself 
  that if he can make everyone in Vallaki happy, the town will slip free of Strahd's dark grasp. His overused 
  catchphrase is ``All will be well!''. Doesn't go anywhere unaccompanied by his two mastiffs.
\subsection{Baroness Lydia Petrovna}
  Wife to Burgomaster Vallakovich and younger sister of Father Petrovich. God-fearing. She laughs at the baron's 
  every comment, to the point of it being a nervous reflex. Throws daily tea-and-sandwich parties in the parlor.
\subsection{Baronet Victor Vallakovich}
  Son of Burgomaster Vallakovich. Confined himself to the attic in order to learn magic in private. Is attempting
  to construct a teleportation circle to escape Barovia.
\subsection{Bildrath Cantemir}
  Proprieter of Bildrath's Mercantile. Doesn't care for adventurers beyond their money. Will offer minor discount
  to adventurers that retrieve previously-sold merchandise for him.
\subsection{Danika Martikov}
  Wereraven. Owns the Blue Water Inn with her husband, Urwin. Usually found tending to the bar. Mother to Brom
  and Bray, who are also wereravens.
\subsection{Father Lucian Petrovich}
  Middle-aged priest. Oversees the church in Vallaki. Assisted by an orphan and altar boy named Yeska.
\subsection{Gadof Blinsky}
  Vallaki's toymaker. Consumed by despair as of late, since no one seems to like him or want his toys. Fascinated
  with eerie playthings. Keeps the doors open by making festival decorations for the Baron. Takes care of 
  Piccolo, Rictavio's pet monkey. Believes in the Baron's message of happiness.
\subsection{Henrik van der Voort}
  Troubled, lonely man. Mediocre carpenter and town coffinmaker. Was tricked by a disguised Strahd into hosting a
  pack of vampire spawn. Paid Milivoj to dig up the bones of St. Andral, on the orders of the vampire spawn.
\subsection{Ireena Kolyana}
  Daught of the former burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich. Sister to Ismark. Striking auburn hair that she dyes 
  black. Strong willed, crude sense of humor, very curious. Knows basic swordplay. Seeks sanctuary from Strahd.
\subsection{Ismark Kolyana}
  Son of the former burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich. Brother to Ireena. Guarded, like all Barovians, but 
  desperate for help with Ireena and Strahd. Willing to pay for help if he cannot persuade.
\subsection{Izek Strazni}
  Henchman for Baron Vallakovich. Orphaned ociopath born without a soul. Has a deformed right arm that can 
  create fire. Dreams (and collects dolls) of Ireena, although doesn't realize she is the woman in his head.
\subsection{Lady Fiona Wachter}
  Influential noble of Vallaki. Loyalist of Strahd. Leads a faux devil worhsip cult. Seeks to be Burgomaster of 
  Vallaki by violently taking the town once she has enough cult members under her control. Employs a
  money-grubbing spy named Ernst Larnak to keep informed of the town's goings-on.
\subsection{Milivoj}
  Brawny lad who tends to the grounds and digs graves. Rarely seen without a shovel. Temperamental. Secretly 
  rejects the burgomaster's ideology, wishes he could protect his younger siblings better, and yearns to be free 
  of Barovia despite feeling hopeless about ever doing so.
\subsection{Morgantha}
  Night hag, disguised as an old woman. Frequently called ``Granny'' by the villagers. Sells Dream Pastries.
\subsection{Nikolai and Karl Wachter}
  Sons of Lady Fiona Wachter, although they never bring this up. Drink heavily and often pick fights, although
  not with well-armed strangers. Love to listen to stories from adventurers. Will try to convince PCs to free
  Vallaki from the burgomaster's madness.
\subsection{Parriwimple}
  Parpol Cantemir, nephew and stock-boy to Bildrath. Simple-minded yet large and powerfully built. Devoted to 
  his uncle, yet loves to ask adventurers about their travels.
\subsection{Rictavio}
  Colorfully dressed half-elf bard that tells tales of faraway places. Secretly Rudolph van Richten, the
  legendary vampire hunter. Quietly gathering information on the Keepers of the Feather and the Vistani. Leaves
  the inn at dawn and dusk to go feed his horse and saber-toothed tiger (yet claims its for the toymaker and pet
  monkey).
\subsection{Stella Wachter}
  Daughter of Lady Wachter. Driven insane by the insults of Victor Vallakovich and thinks she's a cat. Kept 
  locked up in Wachterhaus. Knows none of her mother's secrets besides her desire to overthrow the Baron. Will
  stay in the care of Father Lucian if cured and taken to St. Andral's church.
\subsection{Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin}
  Grim local hunters who frequent the Blue Water Inn. Hunt wolves for a living. Will serve as guides for 5gp/day,
  provide directions in exchange for free drinks, and will only travel at night for exorbitant pay (100gp+) given
  how dangerous it is.
\subsection{Udo Lukovich}
  Shoemaker. Son of Willemina Rikalova. Imprisoned for speaking out against the burgomaster during the Wolf's
  Head Jamboree.
\subsection{Urwin Martikov}
  Wereraven. High-ranking member of the Keepers of the Feather. Owns the Blue Water Inn with his wife, Danika. 
  Usually found working in the kitchen. Father to Brom and Bray, who are also wereravens. Has a poor 
  relationship with his father, Davian Martikov.

  son's freedom.
