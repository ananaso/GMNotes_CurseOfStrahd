\section{Story Notes}
\subsection{Oktober 27}
The party made a beeline for Rictavio's wagon and, after some very deft lockpicking by Cinnamon, discovered they
had just freed an armored tiger. The tiger began to prowl the town, causing mayhem and fear among all the 
townsfolk. Near the tavern, the Party discovered Rictavio attempting to lure the tiger back to his wagon, and he
was pretty pissed at them for letting it out. However, he said the Party could go a long way in redeeming 
themselves by telling Izek and his band of soldiers that the tiger had gone the opposite direction, as well as by 
retrieving a new doll from Blinsky's Toys.

At Blinsky's Toys, the Party met the proprietor, Blinsky - a portly man with a strong accent and interest in all 
things mechanical - and his pet monkey Piccolo. Despite being an Artificer and thus having the potential for 
making a connection with Blinsky, Cinnamon pretended to be a regular rabbit that can't talk. The toys in the shop 
were curiously morbid, and there was even a doll that bore a strange resemblence to Ireena; Blinsky didn't want to 
talk about it, but when pressed he admitted that Izek forces him to make one each month for some unknown reason 
under threat of burning down his shop. The Party bought a duplicate of the previous doll Rictavio had ordered from 
Blinsky - a doll dressed alarming similar to the Vistani - and circled back to Rictavio's wagon. There, Rictavio 
had just finished locking up his wagon again and refused to elaborate further on why he has the tiger, calling 
them mostly even since the Party has at least helped him clean up the mess they made.

\subsection{Oktober 28}
After resting at the tavern for a night, the Party headed out back to the Wizard of Wines to attempt to defeat the
druids there once more. The Martikovs, still waiting in the woods, let the Party know they had spotted a druid in 
the winery sporting a particularly develish-looking staff. Upon approaching the winery, they were attacked again 
by the blights; this time, however the blights kept their distance and seemed to attempt to encircle the Party. To 
prevent this, the Party barricaded themselves inside the winery itself.

Once inside the very dark winery, the Party began to explore and quickly discovered a druid pouring a liquid into
one of the wine vats. Weylan attempted to negotiate a diplomatic resolution, but it was clear the druid was in no
mood for talking and battle commenced. When Patrin came back downstairs to aid his friends, a host of twig blights began pouring out of a crack in one of the wine vats.

\section{Administrative Notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I've created a handful of overlays for the spellcasters that should prove helpful in figuring out where
  their spells will land on the battlefield.
  \item In a similar vein, I've revived 3 twig blights that wouldn't have been hit by Patrin's Burning Hands given
  the overlay's clarified AoE.
\end{itemize}
