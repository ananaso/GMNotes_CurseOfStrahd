\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The Party is incredibly suspicious of Rictavio's wagon given the noises they heard contrasted with the denials 
from the Araseks and Rictavio about anything being inside the wagon. They intend to head over to the Stockyard and 
break into the wagon, which will invariably result in the tiger getting loose and Rictavio's cover being blown.

\section{Potential Threads}
\label{sec:PotentialThreads}
\subsection{Tyger, Tyger}
If the Party opens or breaks into the main door of the wagon, the tiger has a high chance of being able to escape.
When this happens, the tiger will flee the stockyard without harming the players and begin to prowl the streets,
looking for an escape or trying to locate Rictavio or Piccolo. Reports of a ``beast'' running loose in the streets 
sends a panic throughout the town as townsfolk try to scurrying safely into their homes and guards attempt to 
figure out what's going on.

The saber-toothed tiger doesn't harm anyone until it takes damage, whereupon it attacks the perceived source of
the damage. Izek Strazni gathers six town guards and hunts down the beast with the intention of killing it.
Meanwhile, Rictavio does his best to lure the beast back to his wagon while assuring townsfolk that it won't harm
them. He will ask the party to go get a doll from Blinsky's Toys, telling them to request a duplicate of the one 
Rictavio ordered. If the party achieves this without dragging things out too long, Rictavio will succeed in luring 
the tiger back secretly; otherwise, Izek will know that Rictavio is the source of it and run him out of town.

\subsubsection{Development}
If Izek hasn't already determined that Rictavio is the source of the tiger, the Baron will conduct an 
investigation to find out where the ``beast'' came from. Guards and local witnesses are questioned. Gunther and 
Yelena Arasek admit to hearing ``evil growls'' and scratching sounds coming from inside the carnival wagon parked 
in their stockyard. When pressed, the Araseks admit to seeing the wagon's ``weird owner'' routinely drop food into 
the wagon through a hatch in the roof. They also confess that the half-elf paid them for their silence.

After the burgomaster learns that the tiger belongs to Rictavio, he commands his guards to arrest the mysterious 
bard. If Rictavio thinks the PCs can help him (i.e. if they helped him when the tiger was first loose), he asks 
them to distract the burgomaster and the guards while he gathers his horse, wagon, and tiger (in that order). If 
the PCs ask Rictavio where he plans to go, he tells them about an old tower to the west where he can lie low.

\subsection{Wizard of the Wines}
The druids will try to have their blights maintain distance during the fight in order to rely on their more 
powerful ranged attacks, having seen what the Party is capable of now. However, the blights will largely be 
milling about in the vineyard behind/beside the winery rather than in front since the druids don't expect an 
attack anytime soon having driven the Party off already once before. Once a druid appears on the scene, he will 
command the blights to focus on Cinnamon's cannon since they saw the destruction it could wreck last time. The 
Martikovs will have found out that there seems to be a head druid with a devilish-looking staff hiding somewhere
within the winery.

\section{Potential Treasure}
\label{sec:PotentialTreasure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 20 gp discount for retrieving (and not opening) the used merchandise for Bildrath
  \item The ability to ask the Martikovs to deliver the last three barrels of wine to a destination of the 
  Party's choice
\end{itemize}
