\subsection{Oktober 30}
The Party attempted to parley briefly with the werewolves, but they weren't biting. With a handy casting of Magic 
Weapon from Weylan, the Party forced the werewolves back into the cave under the withering fire of Calla's longbow.
Once inside the cave, the Party drew the attention of many more werewolves from deeper inside the caverns but had no
trouble dispatching them -- especially with help from a well-timed fireball from Patrin that crisped all the wolves 
at once.

Unfortunately, during the battle a werewolf managed to get his jaws around Patrin with a solid chomp, and Patrin
promptly was infected with lycanthropy and transformed into a dragonborn/wolf hybrid -- effectively the same form 
the werewolves the Party was facing were in.

After the battle, Calla used her magic to increase the Party's stealth, and she and Cinnamon began sneaking further 
into the cave system to see what else lies in wait for the Party.
