\section{Story Notes}
After burying the old burgomaster, the party returned to the Burgomaster's Mansion but had to camp outside it for
the night since Ismark didn't trust them staying inside his home. In the night, each PC dreamed of an old crone 
that invited them to come see her at the Tser Pool, ``where the mists do not cloud the Inner Eye''. Before 
heading out for Vallaki the next morning, the party visited Bildrath's Mercantile to sell loot and pick up some 
supplies. After complaining about the high prices, Bildrath told them that if they can retrieve a lost package of 
goods downstream of the River Ivlis Bridge he'll give them a 20gp discount on a single purchase. Upon departure, 
Ismark gave the party a letter to explain their task to the Burgomaster of Vallaki and instructed that they bring 
back an official letter of receipt from the Burgomaster that confirms they safely escorted Ireena into his care.

The party traveled west on the Svalich Road to the River Ivlis Crossroads, where there was a gallows and 
graveyard. Right as they were about to leave, Cinnamon noticed a dead Barovian hanging from the gallows where 
there wasn't one before. It melted away like mist when Zarus touched it, although it had looked and smelled 
real. Near the next curve in the road, the party noticed a figure walking towards them. It looked like a zombie 
wearing rusty armor and clutching a gleaming longsword, with what appeared to be a silver dragon emblazoned on 
its tattered tabard. The party hid off either side of the road, but the figure noticed Zarus and Patrin hiding; 
however, it simply continued on its way eastward down the road.

The party then took a short detour to the windmill described in the deed they found in the Durst Mansion. There 
they met a middle-aged woman, the daughter of the old woman that sells pastries in Barovia. After showing her the 
deed and threatening to evict her, a deal was struck that the party could take pastries and twig figurines to 
sell in Vallaki as compensation for rent; the woman mentioned that they should return in a day or two to pick up 
the first batch of pastries.

About halfway between the Western Gate of Barovia and Vallaki, the party saw a skeleton riding a skeletal horse
traveling eastward down the road. He rode along holding a lantern aloft, and although he saw some of the Party he 
simply continued on his way. The party reached the gates of Vallaki around noon and, after showing the guards the 
letter given them by Ismark, were let in to be escorted to the Burgomaster.

%\section{GM Notes}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item The body that cinnamon saw hanging from the gallows was his own, rather than the Barovian the rest of
%  the party saw.
%  \item Zarus overcame his addiction to Dream Pastries, but it doesn't seem to be readily apparent to the Party
%  that the pastries are problematic.
