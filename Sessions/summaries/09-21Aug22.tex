\section{Story Notes}
\subsection{Oktober 29}
Demoralized by the death of their compatriot Zarus and routed by the overwhelming eldritch power of Baba Lysaga,
the Party retreated southwest of Berez to regroup. Following some reflection on their present state, they chose to 
circumvent Berez and return to Vallaki.

Upon entering Vallaki, they were greeted by Lord Vasili von Holtz who was sitting on the steps of the town chapel 
reading a book. He inquired if they had seen Ireena lately, mentioning that he suspects Izek Strazni - but admitted
that everyone finds the man a bit dodgy. After beseeching the Party to keep an eye out for her and to let him know
if they find anything out, he returned to his book on the chapel steps.

After heading to the Arasek Stockyard to once again be generally disappointed by the selection of wares, guards
arrived to summon everyone to the town square. There, the Baron was questioning everyone about the source of the
tiger that had been released to roam the streets. Eventually, he managed to draw a confession out of the Araseks
about Rictavio's cart and threw them in the stocks for accepting bribes before ordering guards to the Blue Water
Inn.

The Party made it to the inn before the guards did, and Rictavio enlisted them to help him skip town. Seeing that
Cinnamon was not making much headway distracting the guards, the rest of the Party came to help. They successfully
deceived the guards that they were operating on orders from Baron Vargas himself, but sent the guards in the 
direction of the Stockyard where Rictavio's Wagon resides - further complicating the escape.
