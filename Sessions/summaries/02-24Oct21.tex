\section{Story Notes}
\subsection{October 24}
The Party was escorted to the Burgomaster's Mansion, where they met Baron Vargas Vallakovich. He seemed rather
pleased and impressed that you safely escorted Ireena the entire way from the Village of Barovia and, after 
writing, sealing, and handing you a letter for Ismark, he invited you to be his honored guests at the upcoming 
Festival of the Burning Sun in 3 days time.

You then headed to the local inn that you had asked one of the guards about, the Blue Water Inn. There you met
Rictavio, a traveling bard who collects and tells tales of strange and wonderous things from across the land. After
purchasing a few glasses of wine from the barkeep, her husband came out and asked you about the wine. After some
smalltalk, he mentioned to you that their wine supply is rather low since the latest shipment from the Wizard of 
Wines is overdue and asked if you'd be able to check it out. The Party agreed and, after a brief and confused
discussion about taking a long rest at the inn, you promptly set out under the setting sun to go investigate the
winery.

It was late in the evening when you arrived at the Wizard of Wines. At the edge of the woods near the winery, you
were greeted by an old man that said Urwin told him to expect you. He let you know that the winery has been overrun
by evil druids and blights, forcing him and his family to take refuge in the woods. Upon closer approach of the 
winery, you were set upon by a mass of blights; the Party stood their ground and made a great showing, but the sheer
weight of numbers and further reinforcements from inside the winery forced you to retreat back to the tree line.

\section{Admin Notes}
There were a number of named NPCs that I forgot to hand out last time:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Rictavio
  \item Vallakovich Family
\end{itemize}
I also moved the time from the map and into a handout, both because it messed up my view on the world map of what
has been revealed to the party and because this will allow you to know what time/date it is even when not on the
map. This handout should be editable by anyone so you can all help me keep track of what time/day it is.
