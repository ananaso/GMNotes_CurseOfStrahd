\subsection{Oktober 29-30}
The Party skillfully managed to redirect the guards from the Blue Water Inn to the Morning Gate by claiming Rictavio
had already escaped that way. Rictavio and the Party then snuck after them into the Stockyard and managed to hook up
the cart and escape before the guards realized they had been duped. There was only one extra seat on the wagon, so
Patrin rode with Rictavio while Weylan and Cinnamon escaped on foot. As the wagon sped out of the stockyard, Weylan 
noticed a shadowy figure jump onto the back of the wagon but couldn't make out any more detail.

While Weylan and Cinnamon snuck over the southern wall of Vallaki using Cinnamon's rope trick, Rictavio and Patrin
were realizing they would have a problem getting through the gates that were barred fast shut and quickly 
approaching. Out of the blue, however, a conspicuously powerful gust of wind blew the Sunset Gate open and the wagon
was able to speed on out.

After getting well down the Old Svalich Road, Rictavio stopped the wagon and they eventually managed to get the
stowaway to reveal herself. Standing on top of the wagon, the wood elf ranger introduced herself as Calla and tried
to assure Rictavio she meant no harm, just wanting to find a way out of Barovio and thinking the strange outlanders 
might be her best bet; having seen her around Vallaki since he'd first arrived there, Rictavio let her continue to 
ride on the top but left it up to the Party to deal with her. After regrouping with Weylan and Cinnamon at the foot 
of Rictavio's tower, the Party accepted Calla in their adventures.

Rictavio showed the Party how the enter the tower - by doing a series of strange gestures in front of it. Inside
the dilapidated tower, they were all lifted up to Rictavio's office on the top floor by the clay statues who hoisted 
the elevator platform. There, the Party was able to speak to Rictavio a good deal about Strahd and Barovia, the 
latter of which he had much less knowledge about.

Looking out a window in the top room, Cinnamon spied a hill across Lake Baratok and, upon reviewing the fortune he
received from Madam Eva, decided on a hunch that that was where he could find the werewolves that kidnapped the kits 
of his village. After a hike around the edge of the lake and an encounter with a sizeable pack of wolves, the Party
found themselves pausing for a short rest near a cave opening further up the hill - and coming out of it were two 
wolves, who seemed to watch the Party from their vantage point.
