\section{Story Notes}
\subsection{Oktober 26}
The party left the windmill and returned to the village of Barovia. After speaking to Ismark about the missing
children and the true nature of Granny and the pastries, they returned Freek and Myrtle to their parents; the 
father answered a few questions about various goings-on in Barovia and the Vistani. The Party then headed over to 
the chapel, took a long rest outside of it, and then headed down the Svalich Road towards Vallaki. Upon reaching 
the lower bridge across the Ivlis River, they took a detour they noticed that ran west into the woods. The Party 
luckily noticed the spike trap set into the path and avoided it before continuing onwards through the woods.

\subsection{Oktober 27}
Passing the Tser Pool, they made it back onto the Svalich Road above Tser Falls and made it to the gates of 
Vallaki without further incident. The guards at the gate were reluctant to let the Party in during the night, but 
were persuaded once the guard remembered he had previously seen them there on official business. The guard 
mentioned that there used to be a mad wizard seen on the north shore of Lake Zarovich, but that had been quite a 
while ago. Once inside, the Party headed to the Blue Water Inn and rented a room from Urwin to pass the morning. 
After a long rest, they headed to the Arasek Stockyard and refunded the Araseks for the bad pastry; Gunther was 
unable to sell them any weapons or armor since those are tightly controlled by the Baron to keep his guards 
armed. The Party returned to the town square and spoke with Ireena again once she arrived for the festival; she 
said she has been generally enjoying her time there, although is a bit creeped out by the Baron's enforcer, Izek.

When the festival was set to start, it began to rain and a guard let slip a laugh when the Baron's torch failed to
light the wooden orb. The Baron punished him, claiming he was clearly a servant of the devil for undermining his
authority and mocking the festivals that protect the town, by dragging him bound behind his horse around the 
square and then having him locked in the stocks. While he then oversaw villagers adding more oil to the orb, the 
Party met Lord Vasili von Holtz, a charming and well-to-do resident of Vallaki. Ireena in particular seemed 
enamored with him and they chatted amiably throughout the entire festival.

The Party then investigated Rictavio's carnival wagon, and seemed to hear something locked inside. Gunther and 
Yeselda didn't seem to know anything about the wagon past that it's owned by Rictavio. Upon returning to the Inn,
the Party spoke with two grizzled wolf hunters who refused to take part in breaking into someone else's property. 
They then spoke with Rictavio in his guest room on the second floor, who claimed that he knew nothing about any 
animals being inside his wagon. Getting nothing further from him, the Party left and resolved to break into the 
wagon.
