\section{Story Notes}
\subsection{Oktober 29}
The Party learned of the magic gemstones - or ``seeds'' as Davian called them - and their connection with the wine
created at The Wizard of Wines. Davian confided in them that all were lost; one to the druids of Yester Hill about
5 days past, one to Baba Lysaga one moon ago, and one from under the night watchman's nose by an unknown thief about 
10 winters past. Cautioned against approaching Baba Lysaga by Davian, the Party headed to Yester Hill to search for 
the seed.

While searching around Yester Hill, Zarus felt a strange voice call out to him on the wind. ``Long have I waited, 
for one who is worthy. My spear hungers for blood. Retrieve it, and rule these mountains in my stead, just like the 
mighty warriors from the early days of the Whispering Wall.'' Heeding the voice, he discovered buried in a cairn a 
blood-stained spear, which seemed to exude a hunger for blood all of its own. At the top of the hill the Party 
discovered an enormous wooden statue of a well-dressed, stern-looking man inside clearing surrounded by a frequently 
lightning-struck stone wall. Further along the hilltop there was a large, twisted tree oozing with a blood-like sap. 
Patrin approached with the Staff of Gulthias, and the blights around the tree ignored him. At the base of the tree 
he discovered a corpse, dressed like an adventurer, who seemingly attempted to cut down a tree with an ornately-
carved battleaxe before perishing. The axe is surprisingly light.

While the Party discussed their next plan of attack, Weylan struck the wooden statue with a mighty thwack and you
all became aware of the much greater number of blights lying in wait beneath the tree - and these did not appear to 
take Weylan's action positively.
