\section{Story Notes}
\subsection{Oktober 29}
Seeing the immediate hostile response generated by the blights (and sensing greater danger nearby) after Weylan 
struck the giant wicker statue, the Party retreated from Yester Hill. Instead they struck out for the ruined village 
of Berez to search for the seed stolen by Baba Lysaga, the terrible witch of cursed and ancient power.

Berez sits on the banks of the Luna River and the village appeared to have long been sinking into the swampy marsh 
it rested on. As the Party approached the outskirts of the village, the Tome of Strahd again surfaced another 
cryptic message from its pages: ``I had nothing left to give but my own life's blood, but it was hers to take. She 
would at last be my bride.'' They also noticed a blinking light on the far side of the river, amid a ring of 
standing stones. However, given the width of the river the Party chose not to attempt a crossing to investigate 
further.

Following the bank of the river to avoid venturing deeper into Berez, the Party found the ruins of a stately 
mansion. Behind the mansion was a now-untamed garden and upon searching the garden the Party was beset (and promptly 
dispatched) by four giant poisonous snakes. Next to the mansion was a pen of goats, the fence of which had many 
skulls set upon it. Upon attempting to break down the fence the skulls began screaming and screeching, and the 
scarecrows the Party had previously noticed scattered around the village roused themselves and began attacking the 
Party.

We left ourselves locked in combat with the scarecrows and Baba Lysaga, who had emerged from her hut in the center 
of Berez and attacked the Party from her flying giant skull.
