\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The Party has just defeated the two ``sisters'' in the windmill, found the Tome of Strahd, and leveled up. With
two children in tow, it would behoove the Party to return them to their parents in the village of Barovia. The
clock is also ticking to return to Vallaki, which will occur at noon on 27 Oct; remember that the Baron has
specifically invited you all as his honored guests.

\section{Potential Threads}
\label{sec:PotentialThreads}
\subsection{Return of the Children to Barovia}
Freek and Myrtle are able to easily lead the Party to their home in the village of Barovia. The parents, Tural 
and Katerina Dargova, are surprised that the children have returned and ask the Party how they convinced Granny 
to return the children. The parents are cagey about why the children were given over to her in the first place 
(given that they are ashamed to be addicted to Dream Pastries) and insist that it was due to her orphanage being 
a safer place for the children. The parents don't have anything of value to give to the Party, but are willing to 
share any lore that they know if the Party asks.

\subsection{Festival of the Blazing Sun}
If the Party returns to Vallaki in time, they will experience the ``Festival of the Blazing Sun'' special event.
If they interferes with the Baron's punishment of the guard and if they are thrown into the stocks, Lord
Vasili von Holtz (Strahd in disguise) will ride up in a carriage driven by a well-dressed coachman; accompanied 
by another manservant, he will get out and charm the Baron, and then convince the Baron that he should release 
the Party since it's a day of celebration. Vasili will notice Ireena standing with the Baroness and go over to 
make smalltalk, acting ``surprised'' to find out that the Party knows her already. After the match he will then 
get back into his carriage and ride off.

If the Party doesn't interfere, Lord Vasili will still ride up and join the distinguished guests. He will introduce himself, make smalltalk (particularly with Ireena), and later head out in his carriage.

Per the faction notes, if the party forgets about the pastry they sold to the Araseks there will be consequences.

\subsection{Wizard of the Wines}
The druids will try to have their blights maintain distance during the fight in order to rely on their more 
powerful ranged attacks, having seen what the Party is capable of now. However, the blights will largely be 
milling about in the vineyard behind/beside the winery rather than in front since the druids don't expect an 
attack anytime soon having driven the Party off already once before. Once a druid appears on the scene, he will 
command the blights to focus on Cinnamon's cannon since they saw the destruction it could wreck last time. The 
Martikovs will have found out that there seems to be a head druid with a devilish-looking staff hiding somewhere
within the winery.

\section{Potential Treasure}
\label{sec:PotentialTreasure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 20 gp discount for retrieving (and not opening) the used merchandise for Bildrath
  \item The ability to ask the Martikovs to deliver the last three barrels of wine to a destination of the 
  Party's choice
\end{itemize}
