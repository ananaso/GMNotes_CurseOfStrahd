\section{Story Notes}
\subsection{October 25}
Following defeat at the winery, the Party retreated back to the woods near where they met the family of vintners.
They spent the night camping to regain their strength, and then returned back through Vallaki to the village of 
Barovia. Ismark was greatly relieved to learn that they had successfully completed the task of escorting Ireena,
and let the Party know he was willing to overlook their previous ``misunderstanding'' at the village chapel; he 
also awarded them with a 50 gp payment for services rendered.

Having now received visions each night of an elderly Vistani woman inviting them to visit her at Tser Pool, the 
Party next made their way there to find the Vistani encampment at Tser Pool. They joined the revelling Vistani
around their campfire for a short while, where they heard a tale of a wizard that came to Barovia and incited a
group of Barovians to march on Castle Ravenloft with him; the storyteller claimed to have look for the wizard's 
body where it fell at the base of Tser Falls but was unable to find trace of the wizard. The Party then received 
their fortunes from Madam Eva, including a handful of personal fortunes that might help each partymember resolve 
some inner turmoil or additional aim that drives them.

\subsection{October 26}
The Party promptly headed to the windmill where they met the pie-making sisters, guided by Madam Eva's revelation 
of a great treasure being located there as well as a desire to pick up their first shipment of pies and twig 
figurines. After a bit of back-and-forth with the sisters being rather cagey about the Party poking around their 
home, combat broke out when the Party discovered two children caged in the top room who claim to be from the 
village of Barovia. The sisters were slain despite their stiff resistance, in large part thanks to the god-tier 
ability of Cinnamon's cannon to make the party immune to non-lethal amounts of damage.

Immediately following the fight, the party searched the windmill to find some treasure along with the Tome of 
Strahd as prophesied by Madam Eva.

\section{Admin Notes}
Another couple things I forgot to reveal as handouts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 2: Barovians, Vistani, Gates of Barovia
  \item Chapter 4: Strahd's Crest
  \item Chapter 5: Rictavio's Carnival Wagon, Vallki Proclamations (both)
  \item Appendix B: Death House's Features
  \item Magic Items: Cloak of Protection (Zarus), Potion of Healing, Tome of Strahd
\end{itemize}
I've also added session summaries to Roll20 in case anyone wants to reference them in the future. Unfortunately though, Roll20 doesn't actually upload PDFs and just converts them into images, so they're pretty clunky.
