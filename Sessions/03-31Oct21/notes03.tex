\label{sec:Characters}
\subsection{Cinnamon (Carter)}
  Rabbitfolk Artillerist Artificer. Far Traveler. From the Feywild. Tends to run away from problems. Came to
  Barovia to hunt down the werewolves that abducted children from his village.
\subsection{Patrin (Chris)}
  Dragonborn Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer. Solider and Officer. Stubborn. Exiled from his clan for an accidental

  Tiefling Barbarian and Undead Warlock. Haunted One. Strong sense of protection for those around him, due to the
  great loss of his family and friends long ago. Avoids entering his rage if possible, since he is addicted to

\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The Party has just retreated back to the tree line where the vintners were waiting. Davian tells the party that
they fought very valiantly and seemed to really pack more of a punch than the druids had been expecting given
how many of their forces they had to muster, but he suspects that defeating the druids is currently a bit out of 
their reach right now. He and his family will keep observing the druids for the time being, attempting to find
patterns or weaknesses that can be exploited when/if the party returns.

\section{Potential Threads}
\label{sec:PotentialThreads}
\subsection{Escorting Ireena to Vallaki}
The Party will return to the Village of Barovia and give Ismark the letter from Baron Vallakovich confirming the
safe arrival of Ireena. He will be overjoyed, as if a huge weight is off his shoulders, and will reward the party
with 50gp. If the party asks to help with anything else, he will mention that there is a rather sensitive issue
concerning Father Donavich's son; he will tell the Party that he is reluctant to officially ask them to help with 
this, however, given their history with the priest.

\subsection{The Tarokka Reading}
The Party will head to Tser Pool Encampment to have their fortunes read by Madam Eva. They may also get a tip
about the Mad Mage if they stay a while to listen around the campfire with the Vistani.

\subsection{Old Bonegrinder}
The Party will run into conflict with the Coven, either by becoming suspicious of the dream pastries once they
discover the effect they have on Gunther and Yelena Arasek or by learning that one of the treasures foretold in
their Tarokka reading (the Tome of Strahd) is in the mill.

\section{Potential Treasure}
\label{sec:PotentialTreasure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 50 gp for escorting Ireena and confirming receipt with Ismark
  \item 20 gp discount for retrieving (and not opening) the used merchandise for Bildrath
\end{itemize}
