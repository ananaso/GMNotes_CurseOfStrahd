  Barovia to hunt down the werewolves that abducted children from his village.

\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The Party finds themselves taking a short rest in the shadow of a hill near the short of Lake Baratok, under the
watchful eye of a two werewolves (in wolf form) in a cave entrance further up the hill (these are the two 
werewolves from Area Z2). If the Party feints as if leaving the area of the cave entrance, the wolves will return 
inside and not be on high alert. Otherwise, the Party will find it impossible to sneak inside besides through the 
upper secret entrance or by drawing the two werewolves out of the cave to kill them out of earshot of the other
inhabitants.

\section{Potential Threads}
\label{sec:PotentialThreads}
\subsection{Leader of the Pack}
Every hour the characters spend inside the werewolf den, roll a d20. On a roll of 18 or higher, the werewolf 
hunting party returns, dragging a dead mountain goat. It's a meager feast, at best. The party consists of Kiril 
Stoyanovich (a werewolf with 90 hit points), six normal werewolves, and nine wolves. All the werewolves arrive in 
wolf form.

If the wolves can see evidence of an assault on the den (such as if the guards at area Z2 are absent or dead), the 
werewolves assume hybrid form. Kiril sends three werewolves up the mountainside to area Z8 to enter the den from 
above while he and the remainder of the hunting party make their way deeper into the den.

\subsubsection{Development}
Zuleika is easily convinced that the Party is the answer to her prayers to Mother Night, and will fight with the
Party if they agree to kill Kiril when he returns. She will reluctantly give up the harengon children, but will 
insist on keeping the human children since it's the only way to grow the pack - which, she will point out, the 
Party just slaughtered (unless they snuck in).

As long as Kiril lives, the characters can't negotiate with the werewolves. If Kiril dies and the characters have 
the upper hand, the pack is willing to negotiate with them.

If the Party defeats Kiril and agrees to look for Emil, Zuleika will release the children and give Cinnamon 
Harkon's Bite, saying that he should show it to Emil to know that she sent them. Zuleika will say that the necklace 
bestows a gift from Mother Night; if someone mentions the ``curse'', she will not understand how spending time as a
wolf could be a curse.

\subsection{Die Kinder}
If the characters get the children away from the den while Kiril is alive, Kiril reassembles his hunting party and 
pursues the lost prisoners relentlessly. If Kiril is dead, the werewolf pack is too preoccupied with determining 
Kiril's successor to organize a hunting party.

If the characters aren't sure where to take the children, a wereraven that has been spying on the den in raven form 
assumes hybrid form and suggests that they take refuge in the nearby village of Krezk. If the characters head that 
way, the wereraven scouts from overhead until the characters reach the village, whereupon it flies south to the 
Wizard of Wines winery and reports what has happened to Davian Martikov.

The children are understandably traumatized by their imprisonment in the werewolf den. They cry and scream the 
whole time they're with the characters. A calm emotions spell quells their anguish for the duration of the spell 
(no saving throws required). A character can try to silence the children for a longer period of time using 
intimidation, or by offering them hope (real or otherwise). The character must make a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation, 
Persuasion, or Deception) check, as appropriate. If the check succeeds, the children remain silent until something 
happens to frighten them.

If the characters take the children to Krezk, the villagers there look after the children and see that they are fed 
and properly clothed. If the characters take them to the Barovia instead, the Burgomaster Ismark Kolyana will allow 
the children to stay at the Burgomaster's Residence until the characters return to collect them; ditto for the 
Martikovs at the Wizard of Wines.
\subsubsection{Potential Handouts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Monster Handouts
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Wereraven
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pack Attack}
If the characters blew up Ezmerelda's wagon, activated the lightning sheath around the tower, or caused the tower 
to collapse, the sound of their handiwork echoes through the valley as far west as Krezk and as far east as 
Vallaki. The disturbance attracts the attention of a pack of werewolves, which arrives after 1 hour.

The werewolves haunt the Svalich Woods west of Van Richten's Tower. They come running in wolf form, hoping to trap 
prey on the island by cutting off access to the causeway. Leading the hunt is Kiril Stoyanovich, a werewolf with 90 
hit points. Accompanying him are six normal werewolves and nine wolves. While in wolf form, the werewolves are 
indistinguishable from ordinary wolves. They either remain in wolf form or assume hybrid form.

The werewolves know that the tower has magical defenses, so they are cautious. Kiril tries to lure the characters 
outside for a final showdown, but pulls his pack into the woods if the characters start making ranged attacks from 
the tower. Remember that spells are supressed by Khazan's Spell Drain on the tower.

A captured werewolf can be forced to divulge the whereabouts of the rabbit children kidnapped by the pack. They are 
being held in a cave to the west.

  \item Named NPC Handouts
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Kiril
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Druids' Ritual on Yester Hill}
The next time the Party returns to Yester Hill, as they begin to climb the hill they will hear a thundering 
growing from the road into the woods where they came from and a steadily growing light from the same direction. 
The Party will feel a great wave of dread from whatever unknown evil is approaching. Assuming they hide to watch, 
Strahd will arrive astride Beucephalus, and upon reaching the Gulthias Tree the druids will arise from their 
``graves'' to begin the ceremony. The Party won't know what is occurring, but will have the sense that it is a 
ceremony of twisted evil and must be stopped.
