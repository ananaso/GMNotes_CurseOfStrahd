\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The Party finds themselves trying to aid Rictavio in escaping Vallaki, but they have sent the town guards towards 
the stockyard where Rictavio's wagon is. They'll have to find another way to divert the guards so that Rictavio can 
hitch the wagon up to his horse and get out of town.

Helping Rictavio will draw the ire of the Baron, however, and the Party will also get run out of town and
subsequently banned; the only way inside will be sneaking over the walls under cover of darkness or using a 
diguise, which will prove extremely difficult without the help of magic given their very unique appearances.

If the NPCs inquire strongly, Rictavio will be willing to divulge his true identity as Dr. Rudolf van Richten.

\section{Potential Threads}
\label{sec:PotentialThreads}
\subsection{Return to Berez}

\subsection{Pack Attack}
If the characters blew up Ezmerelda's wagon, activated the lightning sheath around the tower, or caused the tower 
to collapse, the sound of their handiwork echoes through the valley as far west as Krezk and as far east as 
Vallaki. The disturbance attracts the attention of a pack of werewolves, which arrives after 1 hour.

The werewolves haunt the Svalich Woods west of Van Richten's Tower. They come running in wolf form, hoping to trap 
prey on the island by cutting off access to the causeway. Leading the hunt is Kiril Stoyanovich, a werewolf with 90 
hit points. Accompanying him are six normal werewolves and nine wolves. While in wolf form, the werewolves are 
indistinguishable from ordinary wolves. They either remain in wolf form or assume hybrid form.

The werewolves know that the tower has magical defenses, so they are cautious. Kiril tries to lure the characters 
outside for a final showdown, but pulls his pack into the woods if the characters start making ranged attacks from 
the tower. Remember that spells are supressed by Khazan's Spell Drain on the tower.

A captured werewolf can be forced to divulge the whereabouts of the rabbit children kidnapped by the pack. They are 
being held in a cave to the west.

\subsection{Druids' Ritual on Yester Hill}
The next time the Party returns to Yester Hill, as they begin to climb the hill they will hear a thundering 
growing from the road into the woods where they came from and a steadily growing light from the same direction. 
The Party will feel a great wave of dread from whatever unknown evil is approaching. Assuming they hide to watch, 
Strahd will arrive astride Beucephalus, and upon reaching the Gulthias Tree the druids will arise from their 
``graves'' to begin the ceremony. The Party won't know what is occurring, but will have the sense that it is a 
ceremony of twisted evil and must be stopped.
