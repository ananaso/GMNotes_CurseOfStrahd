\section{Strong Start}
\label{sec:StrongStart}
The Party is engaged in battle with Baba Lysaga and her scarecrows. If they destroy her flying skull Baba Lysaga 
will retreat to the hut (likely by Misty Step) to protect ``Strahd'', her ``child''. If they kill her before ever 
entering the hut, the illusion will disappear.
\subsubsection{Potential Handouts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Named NPC Handouts
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Baba Lysaga's Creeping Hut
  \end{itemize}
  \item Monster Handouts
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Crawling Claw
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Potential Threads}
\label{sec:PotentialThreads}

\subsection{Izek abducts Ireena}
The next time the Party enters Vallaki, they will run into Lord Vasili von Holtz sitting on the steps outside the church reading a book titled ``Guide to Vampire Hunting - Rudolph Van Richten''. If asked about it, he will claim to be ``studying his enemy''. If asked what he's learned about vampires, he'll give misleading tips like the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Vampires are scared of fire because it produces light.
  \item Splashing holy water on a vampire prevents them from shapeshifting.
  \item Don't look in the eyes of a vampire or you risk being permanently put under its spell.
  \item A vampire can be killed by driving a silver stake into his heart.
  \item Dragging a vampire against his will across a threshold will prevent him from leaving that building.
  \item Vampires are weaker in their lair because they tend to let their guard down.
\end{itemize}
Vasili will ask the Party if they've seen Ireena anywhere, claiming to have not seen her for a few days now. If 
the Party asks when the last time he saw her was, he'll say they had dinner together and spent an evening 
strolling the town. If they ask if he has any hunches, he'll say he's ``a little suspicious of Izek, but then 
again, who isn't?''.
\subsubsection{Potential Handouts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Text Handouts
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tome of Strahd: The Town of Vallaki
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tyger, Tyger: Development}
The next time the Party returns to the tavern in Vallaki, they will notice a commotion in the town square; this 
will be the Baron conducting an investigation to find out where the ``beast'' came from. Guards and local 
witnesses are questioned. Gunther and Yelena Arasek admit to hearing ``evil growls'' and scratching sounds coming 
from inside the carnival wagon parked in their stockyard. When pressed, the Araseks admit to seeing the wagon's 
``weird owner'' routinely drop food into the wagon through a hatch in the roof. They also confess that the half-
elf paid them for their silence.

After the burgomaster learns that the tiger belongs to Rictavio, he commands his guards to arrest the mysterious 
bard. If Rictavio thinks the PCs can help him (i.e. if they helped him when the tiger was first loose), he asks 
them to distract the burgomaster and the guards while he gathers his horse, wagon, and tiger (in that order). If 
the PCs ask Rictavio where he plans to go, he tells them about an old tower to the west where he can lie low.
Helping Rictavio will draw the ire of the Baron, however, and the Party will also get run out of town and
subsequently banned; the only way inside will be sneaking over the walls under cover of darkness or using a 
diguise, which will prove extremely difficult without the help of magic given their very unique appearances.
\subsubsection{Potential Handouts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Text Handouts
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tome of Strahd: V (Van Richten's Tower)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Druids' Ritual on Yester Hill}
The next time the Party returns to Yester Hill, as they begin to climb the hill they will hear a thundering 
growing from the road into the woods where they came from and a steadily growing light from the same direction. 
The Party will feel a great wave of dread from whatever unknown evil is approaching. Assuming they hide to watch, 
Strahd will arrive astride Beucephalus, and upon reaching the Gulthias Tree the druids will arise from their 
``graves'' to begin the ceremony. The Party won't know what is occurring, but will have the sense that it is a 
ceremony of twisted evil and must be stopped.
\subsubsection{Potential Handouts}

  \item Named NPC Handouts
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Strahd von Zarovich
