\section{Ismark Kolyana}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ismark is currently skeptical that the party aren't vagabonds or evildoers, having found out what they did
  to his village's church and Father Donavich. They can earn his trust by successfully escorting his sister Ireena
  to Vallaki and returning with proof that the task was completed satisfactorily.
\end{itemize}

\section{Keepers of the Feather}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Keepers of the Feather believe that the party is evil, likely servants of Strahd, due to Muriel's 
  report of the party ransacking the church in Barovia and terrorizing Father Donavich.
\end{itemize}

\section{Strahd von Zarovich}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Strahd is aware that the party destroyed Death House permanently since they buried Walter's corpse and 
  thus released his soul and the curse on the house.
  \item Strahd is aware that one of the party somehow met an Evil Vestige. Strahd doesn't know this, but the 
  Vestige was Norganas, Finger of Oblivion; Norganas was able to communicate due to Death House amplifying his 
  power.
\end{itemize}
