\section{Bildrath Cantemir}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bildrath offered a 20gp discount on a single purchase if the Party retrieves a lost package downstream of
  the Ivlis River Bridge.
\end{itemize}

\section{Druids of Yester Hill}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Druids believe the Martikovs have hired a skilled party of adventurers to try to retake the winery,
  although having driven the party off once don't suspect another attack in the near future.
\end{itemize}

\section{Gunther and Yelena Arasek}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gunther purchased a dream pastry from the party, not realizing that it is highly addictive. If the Party
  fails to recover the pastry the next time they are in Vallaki, the Araseks will be upset to have been sold
  substance-laced food and will refuse to do businesss with them unless they can be convinced (Persuasion DC20,  
  reduced to DC15 if a convincing argument is RP'd). If the Party threatens them, the Araseks will later report
  them to the Baron, turning him hostile unless proof that they killed the hags is given.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ireena Kolyana}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ireena is very grateful to the party for safely escorting her to Vallaki (with minimal detours).
\end{itemize}

\section{Ismark Kolyana}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ismark is currently skeptical that the party aren't vagabonds or evildoers, having found out what they did
  to his village's church and Father Donavich. They have earned his trust by successfully escorting his sister 
  Ireena to Vallaki and returning with proof that the task was completed satisfactorily.
\end{itemize}

\section{Keepers of the Feather}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Keepers of the Feather believe that the party is evil, likely servants of Strahd, due to Muriel's 
  report of the party ransacking the church in Barovia and terrorizing Father Donavich.
  \item Urwin is testing the party's true mettle and alliegance by asking they go check out what has delayed the
  latest shipment of wine from The Wizard of Wines winery. If they are able to succeed with this quest, they
  will likely regain his confidence.
\end{itemize}

\section{Madam Eva}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Madam Eva has appeared to the party in their dreams, requesting they come visit her at the Tser Pool, 
  ``where the mists do not cloud the Inner Eye''.
\end{itemize}

\section{Morgantha's Coven}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The coven was broken when the party slew the two ``sisters'' at Old Bonegrinder. Morgantha is aware of 
  their deaths but unaware precisely who is behind it. She will be focused exclusively on determining who 
  perpetrated this agression against the coven and then will try to haunt them relentlessly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rictavio}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The party doesn't seem to suspect that he is anything more than what he claims, a traveling bard.
\end{itemize}

\section{Strahd von Zarovich}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Strahd is aware that the party destroyed Death House permanently since they buried Walter's corpse and 
  thus released his soul and the curse on the house.
  \item Strahd is aware that one of the party somehow met an Evil Vestige. Strahd doesn't know this, but the 
  Vestige was Norganas, Finger of Oblivion; Norganas was able to communicate due to Death House amplifying his 
  power.
\end{itemize}

\section{Vargas Vallakovich}
\begin{itemize}
  \item He was impressed by the Party's dutiful escorting of Ireena into his care and has invited them to be his
  honored guests at the upcoming Festival of the Burning Sun in 3 days time (27 Oct).
\end{itemize}
