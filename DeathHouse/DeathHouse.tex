\begin{readout}
As you continue up the road, dark storm clouds quickly begin to gather and before long a vicious thunderstorm has 
erupted; the wind is whipping violently, the rain is heavy like it's trying to pound you into the ground beneath 
you, and the flashes of lightning are often a bit too close for comfort.

In the distance farther down the road, you see a light in the darkness. As you approach it, you can begin making 
out more detail -- the light is a lantern held by a girl, probably a bit younger than teenage, and a boy a few 
years younger still. They are both standing beneath the awning over the front door of an old house, where the 
girl appears to be sheltering the boy from the rain and waving to you as if trying to signal for help.
The boy is holding a stuffed doll fearfully. The house is flanked by two sad-looking structures;
one appears to be a servants' house and the other a stable.

If the PCs take a long rest in this or any other room of Death House, roll to randomly select a PC to have
a nightmare while resting. This PC will receive a level of exhaustion upon waking. Use one or all of the
following haunts while the PCs sleep:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A PC hears rats scrabbling up and down the spaces between the walls.
  \item A PC hears footsteps descending from the attic and stopping outside of their door before moving away
  to the library. Soon after, a grinding noise can be heard coming from the library (the sound of a secret door).
  \item A PC hears maniacal laughter echoing from far below the House.
  \item A PC experiences a false awakening, wherein they wake to see that one of their friends has been replaced
  by a ghast, which is slowly creeping towards another PC. If the PC stays still, the ghast slices open its
  victim's throat and the PC watches their friend bleed out before waking up.
  \item A PC overhears a whispered argument about parentage. A pleading female voice in the PC's right ear
  swears that ``it isn't his''. A cold female voice in the PC's left ear scoffs, and says that it doesn't care.
\end{itemize}
If the PCs damage anything on the first or second floor in their search for traps or treasure and return to
any such chambers after a long rest, let them know that the rooms have been restored to pristine condition.
