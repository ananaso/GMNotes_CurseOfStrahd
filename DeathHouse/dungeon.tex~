\subsection{Dungeon Level Access}
\label{sec:DungeonLevelAccess}
\begin{readout}
  The wooden spiral staircase from the attic ends in a narrow tunnel that stretches southward before branding east
  and west. The tunnel appears to be carved directly out of earth, clay, and rock. The tunnels are 4 feet wide by
  7 feet high with timber braces at 5-foot intervals. The tunnel is absolutely dark, almost to the point where
  it feels like the shadows are pressing in towards you.
  
  As you reached the bottom of the stairs and started moving into the tunnel, you began to hear an eerie, incessant
  chant echoing throughout.
\end{readout}
It's impossible to gauge where the sound is coming until the PCs reach the Hidden Spike Pit (Area 26) or Ghoulish
Encounter (Area 29). They can't discern its words until they reach the Reliquary (Area 35).

If PCs have light or darkvision as they begin to move into the tunnel:
\begin{readout}
  As you begin to explore the dungeon, you see seemingly centuries-old human footprints in the earthen floor
  leading every which way.

\subsection{Family Crypts}
\label{sec:FamilyCrypts}
Several crypts have been hewn from the earth. Each crypt is sealed with a stone slab unless noted otherwise.
Removing a slab from its fitting requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; using a crowbar or
the like grants advantage on the check.

\subsubsection{Empty Crypt}
\begin{readout}
  The blank stone slab meant to seal this crypt leans against a nearby wall. The crypt is empty.
\end{readout}

\subsubsection{Walter's Crypt}
\begin{readout}
  The stone slab meant to seal this crypt leans against a nearby wall. Etched into it is the name
  ``Walter Durst''. The crypt is empty.
\end{readout}

\subsubsection{Gustav's Crypt}
\begin{readout}
  The stone slab is etched with the name ``Gustav Durst''.
  
  \textit{If PCs open the crypt:} The chamber beyond contains a coffin atop a stone bier.
  
  \textit{If PCs open/disturb the coffin:} The coffin is empty.
\end{readout}

\subsubsection{Elisabeth's Crypt}
\begin{readout}
  The stone slab is etched with the name ``Elisabeth Durst''.
  
  \textit{If PCs open the crypt:} The crypt contains a stone bier with a coffin atop it.
  
  \textit{If PCs open/disturb the coffin:} A swarm of centipedes boils out of the back wall and attacks!
\end{readout}

\subsubsection{Rose's Crypt}
\begin{readout}
  The stone slab is etched with the name ``Rosavalda Durst''.
  
  \textit{If PCs open the crypt:} The chamber beyond contains a coffin on a stone bier.
  
  \textit{If PCs open the coffin:} The coffin is empty.
  
  \textit{If PCs place Rose's skeletal remains in the coffin:} You hear a light sigh on the air as well as a
  faint ``Thank you!'' in Rose's voice; she sounds relieved. \{\textit{If a PC is possessed by Rose:} You feel 
  Rose's presence leave you; you are no longer possessed.\}
\end{readout}

\subsubsection{Thorn's Crypt}
\begin{readout}
  The stone slab is etched with the name ``Thornboldt Durst''.
  
  \textit{If PCs open the crypt:} The chamber beyond contains a coffin on a stone bier.
  
  \textit{If PCs open the coffin:} The coffin is empty.
  
  \textit{If PCs place Thorn's skeletal remains in the coffin:} You hear a light woosh as well as a faint,
  almost upbeat or happy ``Bye!'' in Thorn's voice. \{\textit{If a PC is possessed by Thorn:} You feel Thorn's
  presence leave you; you are no longer possessed.\}

\subsection{Well and Cultist Quarters}
\label{sec:WellAndCultistQuarters}
\begin{readout}
  A 4-foot-diameter well shaft with a 3-foot-high stone lip descends 30 feet to a water-filled cistern.
  A wooden bucket hangs from a rope-and-pulley mechanism bolted to the crossbeams above the well. There are
  five siderooms that each contain a wood-framed bed with a moldy straw matress and a wooden chest, presumably
  for personal belongings. Each chest is secured with a rusty iron padlock.
\end{readout}
The padlocks can all be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

\subsubsection*{Treasure}
In addition to some worthless personal effects, each chest contains one or more valuable items.
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textit{25\Alph*.}}]
  \item This room's chest contains 11 gp and 60 sp in a pouch made of human skin.
  \item This room's chest contains three moss agates (worth 10 gp each) in a folded piece of black cloth.
  \item This room's chest contains a black leather eyepatch with a carnelian (worth 50 gp) sewn into it, along
      with a logbook bound in grimy black leather. This journal maintains a list of names, physical
      descriptions, and details of some sort of event. The details in this third column are rather gruesome,
      detailing what happened to each listed person in terms such as ``struggled profusely'' and ``no sedative 
      given''; from what you can glean, these appear to be describing how the persons listed were sacrificed
      for some unknown purpose.
      
      \{\textit{GM Note:} The journal was kept by one of the head cultists as a record of the cult's victims.\}
  \item This room's chest contains an ivory hairbrush with silver bristles (worth 25 gp).
  \item This room's chest contains a silvered shortsword (worth 110 gp).

\subsection{Hidden Spike Pit}
\label{sec:HiddenSpikePit}
\begin{readout}
  The ghostly chanting heard throughout the dungeon gets discernibly louder as you turn down this tunnel. 
\end{readout}
Pull the first player to enter this hallway into a breakout room, and continue with:
\begin{readout}
  As you turn the corner, something strikes you as odd about this hallway but you can't quite put your finger
  on it.
  
  \{\textit{Have them roll against a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.}\}
  
  \textit{Success:} You notice that there is a distinct absence of footprints in this hallway. This is in stark
  contrast to all the other tunnels you've been in down here, which had plenty of very noticeable centuries-old
  footprints leading every which way.
  
  \textit{Failure:} You don't detect anything, and the feeling passes. It must have just been in your head,
  perhaps something about these tunnels making you a bit more paranoid than you normally would be.
\end{readout}
If PCs search for traps:
\begin{readout}
  You find a 5-foot-long, 10-foot-deep pit hidden under several rotted wooden planks, all hidden under a thin
  layer of dirt. The pit has sharpened wooden spikes at the bottom.
\end{readout}
The first PC to step on the cover falls through, landing prone and taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall
plus 2d10 piercing damage from the spikes.

\subsection{Dining Hall}
\label{sec:DiningHall}
\begin{readout}
  This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Moldy humanoid bones lie strewn on the dirt
  floor. In the middle of the south wall is a darkened alcove.
\end{readout}
The bones are the remains of the cult's vile banquets. PCs who approach within 5 feet of the alcove (Area 28)
provoke the creature that lurks there.

\subsection{Larder}
\label{sec:Larder}
This alcove contains a grick that slithers out to attack the first character it sees within 5 feet of it.
Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score under 12 is surprised by it. The alcove is otherwise
empty.

\subsection{Ghoulish Encounter}
\label{sec:GhoulishEncounter}
\begin{readout}
  The ghostly chanting heard throughout the dungeon is noticeably louder to the north. However, you're struck
  by an overpowering stench of death and decay coming from down the hallway.
\end{readout}
When one or more PCs reach the midpoint of the four-way tunnel intersection:
\begin{readout}
  As you walk into the center of this intersection, a decaying, clawed hand bursts out of the ground and
  grips your foot like a vice.
\end{readout}
Have the affected PC roll a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against a ghoul's Strength
(Athletics) check. If they succeed, they're able to take a surprise round. Otherwise, combat begins normally.

Two ghouls (reduced from four to make this simply hard rather than deadly, per Kobold Fight Club) rise up
out of the ground in the two closest spaces marked X on the map and attack. The ghouls fight until destroyed.

As the ghouls are the undead forms of the former cultists, they retain some vestige of their former selves.
They mindlessly repeat any or all of the following phrases as they attack the PCs: ``Beautiful. We're so
beautiful''; ``Nothing can hurt us''; ``We are perfect. We are immortal''; and ``Help us live forever''.

\subsection{Stairs Down}

\begin{readout}
  You approach a 20-foot-long flight of stairs leading further down into the dungeon. It's obvious that the
  ghostly chants originate from somewhere below.

\subsection{Darklord's Shrine}
\label{sec:DarklordsShrine}
\begin{readout}
  This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls. A wide alcove
  in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing
  a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands next to him. In his
  right hand, he holds a smoky-gray crystal orb. There are five ashen shadows burned into the walls, with soot
  marks stretching across the floor toward the statue.
  
  The room has exits in the west and north walls. Chanting can be heard coming from the west.
\end{readout}
The statue depicts Strahd, to whom the cultists made sacrifices in the vain hope that he might reveal his
darkest secrets to them. The skeletons on the wall are harmless decor.

If a PC approaches the statue:
\begin{readout}
  As you approach the statue, you can hear many voices whispering: ``His gaze burns upon us''; ``The Darklord's
  eyes are always watching''; and ``He is the Ancient; He is the land''
\end{readout}

If the characters disturb the crystal orb in Strahd's hand:
\begin{readout}
  The five shadows begin swooping across the walls menacingly. You hear murmured moans, including phrases
  such as ``Begone from this place!'' and ``Look not upon us!''.
\end{readout}
If the PCs leave without taking the orb or moving it from Strahd's hand, the shadows don't attack. Otherwise, 
two shadows attack after 1 round, two shadows the round after that, and the final shadow a round after the
second pair of shadows. The shadows (the spirits of former cultists) pursue those who flee beyond the room's
confines.

\subsubsection*{Concealed Door}
PCs searching the room for secret doors find a concealed door in the middle of the east wall with a successful
DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.
\begin{readout}
  You discover an ordinary -- albeit rotted -- wooden door hidden under a layer of clay. The door pulls open
  to reveal a stone staircase that climbs 10 feet to a landing.
\end{readout}
The staircase goes to the Hidden Trapdoor (Area 32).

\subsubsection*{Treasure}
The crystal orb is worth 25 gp. It can be used as an arcane focus but is not magical.

\subsection{Hidden Trapdoor}
\label{sec:HiddenTrapdoor}
\begin{readout}
  The staircase ends at a landing with a 6-foot-high ceiling of close-fitting planks with a wooden trapdoor
  set into it. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side
\end{readout}
If the trapdoor is pushed open, it reveals the den (Area 3) above.

\subsubsection*{Development}
Once the trapdoor has been found and opened, it remains available to PCs as a way into and out of the
dungeon level.

\subsection{Cult Leaders' Den}
\label{sec:CultLeadersDen}
\begin{readout}
  A chandelier is suspended above a table in the middle of the room. Two high-backed chairs flank the table,
  which has an empty clay jub and two clay flagons atop it. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners, their
  candles long since melted away.
\end{readout}
The door in the southwest is a mimic in disguise. Any creature that touches the door becomes adhered to the
creature, whereupon the mimic attacks. The mimic also attacks if it takes any damage; if it's attacked at
range by a wary or alerted PC, however, it flees, vanishing around the corner and reappearing as a door,
chest, or longsword elsewhere in the dungeon.

\subsection{Cult Leaders' Quarters}
\label{sec:CultLeadersQuarters}
\begin{readout}
  This room contains a large wood-framed bed with a rotted feather mattress, a wardrobe containing several old
  robes, a pair of iron candlesticks, and an open crate containing thirty torches and a leather sack with
  fifteen candles inside it. At the foot of the bed is a wooden footlocker.
\end{readout}
When a PC removes anything from the chest:
\begin{readout}
  
\end{readout}

\subsubsection*{Treasure}
\begin{readout}
  The footlocker is unlocked and contains the following gear and magic items:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Folded cloak of protection
    \item Small unlocked wooden coffer containing four potions of healing
    \item Chain shirt
    \item Mess kit
    \item Flask of alchemist's fire
    \item Bullseye lantern
    \item Set of thieves' tools
    \item Spellbook with a yellow leather cover
  \end{itemize}
\end{readout}
The spellbook contains the following wizard spells:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \nth{1} Level:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Disguise Self
    \item Identfy
    \item Mage Armor
    \item Magic Missile

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Darkvision
    \item Hold Person
    \item Invisibility
    \item Magic Weapon

\end{itemize}
These items were taken from adventurers who were drawn into Barovia, captured, and killed by the cult.
